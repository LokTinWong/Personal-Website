Say hello to Editorial, a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking" sidebar (scroll down to see what I mean) and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP, but I figured for my 41st (!!!) template I'd change it up a little. Enjoy :)

The original demo images were part of the template, but all were later removed as Lok Tin has no need of them.

### Content
All content is written by Lok Tin Wong, without the assistance of the template or any AI tools.

### `assets` Folder:
The majority (over 99%) of the `assets` folder is made by the original template. Lok Tin only made minor design changes to better suit his website.

### `images` Folder
Since the demo images were removed, all images in the images folder are created by Lok Tin himself (except `badge.jpg`). These are unique and do not exist anywhere else on the internet.

### `music` Folder
`sm2.mp3` originates from https://youtu.be/kwX5bcmdgDU?si=jeq8g5_-72tLQrKM.
