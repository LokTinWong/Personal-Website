											<h1>Lok Tin Wong</h1>
											<p>About Me</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											I am born in Hong Kong and lived there for 15 years, until my family moved to Vancouver in 2022. In Chinese, my name <i>Lok Tin</i> (樂天)
											means <i>optimistic</i>. It just so happens that I am not usually disappointed or saddened by a situation for too long. Though it does
											depend on the said situation, I am generally quick to move on and attempt to see things in a different light, perhaps a better, more optimistic
											light. My parents never gave me an English name. <i>Lok Tin</i> has much more meaning than a generic English name, and reminds me of my roots.
											Even if I could change my name now, I would still prefer <i>Lok Tin</i>.
										</p>

										<p>
											Note: Please do not simplify my name to <i>Lok</i>. My sister is called <i>Lok Yee</i>, and merely Lok would not differentiate me from her.
											The number of times I have been called <i>Lok</i> by teachers or emails is rather irritating. <i>Lok</i> alone means <i>joy</i>, but that is
											not me. I am Lok Tin.
										</p>

										<p>
											I may not be immune to procrastination, but when I am <i>locked in</i>, or in other words, <i>focused</i> or <i>in the zone</i>, I can make great progress in a
											short period of time. I do not normally use internet slang, but <i>locked in</i> is my high school namesake, for it sounds just like <i>Lok Tin</i>. I treat
											it as a compliment, or a reminder to stay on top of things. I take pride in completing tasks ahead of time; fighting deadlines is not preferable for me.
										</p>

										<p>
											I would call myself a good listener, staying silent as needed and not speaking out of place. I do not normally dominate conversations and make myself the centre
											of attention. Instead, I try to	give everyone a chance to speak while making my own contributions. In the case of group work, I am careful to credit each member;
											I would much rather share the spoils than to take it all for my own. 
										</p>

										<p>
											Long before we had the idea to leave Hong Kong, my parents have always provided me with many opportunities to learn English,
											from books, kindergartens with foreign instructors, to <i>Skype</i> lessons taught by a South African teacher. I would specifically
											credit this <i>Skype</i> teacher, along with my parents for my current proficiency in English. I can speak fluent Cantonese and English,
											as well as intermediate Mandarin. I can write in Traditional Chinese and English. I cannot write in Simplified Chinese, but I can
											interpret some of their characters.

												<h3>Reading</h3>
												<p>
													I have been reading since I was still drinking milk from a baby bottle, thanks to my parents
													seeing great value in books. <i>Horrid Henry</i> and <i>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</i> were some of my favourites.
													Now, I enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction. Fiction includes <i>Percy Jackson</i>, <i>Tom Clancy</i>,
													and <i>The Horus Heresy</i>. Non-fiction is mostly centred around history, a passion of mine, but also
													books about daily-life physics and firearms (educational purposes only).

												<h3>History</h3>
												<p>
													History is my passion. I am into the idea that we can learn from our mistakes in history, even if
													history is rather cyclical. Although I major in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, I have still taken
													history courses in my first two years of university, to further my knowledge. I have not quite decided
													which aspect or time period of history I am most interested in, but I am leaning towards military history.
													I listen to a Swedish metal band, <i>Sabaton</i>, that sings about war stories and correlates with my
													passion.

												<h3>Programming</h3>
												<p>
													My first exposure to programming was playing around with <i>Scratch</i> in primary school, making simple
													platformer games and a dance sequence with several photoshopped frames. Later in secondary/high school and
													my first year of university, I worked on bigger projects with HTML and CSS, JavaScript, and Java.

												<h3>Video Games</h3>
												<p>
													I enjoy playing single-player games, especially ones with a story. Examples include <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i>,
													<i>Watch Dogs 2</i>, and <i>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</i>. Playing through a well-crafted story gives me the same,
													if not more satisfaction than reading a fictional novel. In a text-based role-playing game called <i>Torn</i>,
													I have met a group of great friends. Together, we have built a community of over 200 players in the span of two years.
													I get to use my	programming abilities and <i>Discord</i> expertise to assist the operation of the said community.

												<h3>Video Editing</h3>
												<p>
													I have a YouTube channel of six years with over 200 videos (including the vast majority that I have set to private).
													I used to enjoy recording my gameplay, editing them into videos and uploading them to my channel. With my abilities,
													I have once helped my mother to edit a video of her giving a lecture about Speech Therapy.

												<h3>Writing</h3>
												<p>
													Reading and writing came hand in hand. As I enjoy reading stories, I also relish in writing my own stories, mostly inspired
													the books I read, the games I play, and military history in general.

												<p>
													<strong>Kau Yan School</strong>, Hong Kong.
												</p>
												<p>
													I have very vague memories of using <i>Code.org</i> and <i>Scratch</i> to learn basic block-based coding. I particularly
													remember the <i>Minecraft Hour of Code</i> activities. They were designed to take around an hour to complete, and I recall
													finishing them quite quickly.

												<p>
													In these 3.5 years, I spent more time with <i>Scratch</i>, picked up HTML and CSS, and even had a very brief experience with <i>Unity</i>.
													I remember dedicating a lot of time into <i>Scratch</i> outside of class, collaborating with online users to make small games.

												<h3>High School (Grade 10.5 to 12)</h3>
												<p>
													<strong>Pinetree Secondary School</strong>, Coquitlam, BC, Canada.
												</p>
												<p>
													My first official volunteering experience was during high school. The requirement to graduate was 30 hours, but I ended up
													logging 51 hours of picking up garbage, gardening at the Town Centre Park, and removing invasive plants in a nearby creek.
												</p>
												<p>
													Computer Programming 11 and 12 taught me the basics of Java, which was really helpful for first year in university. I made
													console-based games and later got to recreate <i>Pong</i> and <i>Snake</i> in JavaFX.

												<h3>University</h3>
												<p>
													<strong>The University of British Columbia</strong>, Vancouver, BC, Canada.
												</p>
												<p>
													I finished my first year in UBC with a 87.8 average, taking three <strong>Computer Science</strong> (CPSC) courses over two
													terms. CPSC 110 was particularly difficult as it was my first exposure to recursion. I started the course grumbling about
													the lectures but later understood the concepts through hard work. As a wise man once said, "Just trust the natural recursion!"
													I saw more use with Java in CPSC 210, learning how to make programs composed of multiple files and with a fully-functional GUI.

										<h2>Online Aliases</h2>
									</header>

									<h3>ColtCobra</h3>

									<p>
										Made this as my online username over six years ago. I searched for "cool gaming usernames", found <i>Colt</i> and <i>Cobra</i> next to each
										other on the list, and pieced them tegether.
									</p>

									<h3>Per5eus</h3>

									<p>
										Inspired by Perseus, the Greek hero, and Percy Jackson. Replaced the first <i>s</i> with a <i>5</i> because <i>Perseus</i> was taken and
										<i>5</i> resembles <i>s</i>.
									</p>

									<h3>LokSn</h3>

									<p>
										The chemical symbol of tin is Sn. LokSn is LokTin (my actual name is Lok Tin, with a space in between, but usernames often do not allow
										spaces).

										<h2>Opinion on Online Slang</h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										This section will cover my opinion on online slang, specifically the ones that are most prevalent in 2025. I think it is natural for
										a language to evolve and have new slangs as time passes, but I am unsure if we are evolving for the better if new slangs do not make
										much sense.
									</p>

									<p>
										As someone who spends a fair bit of time writing, it is upsetting to see nonsensical slangs being used rather than the countless beautiful
										words in the language. Of course, no one is expected to write formally when commenting online, but should one not uphold basic grammar,
										proper punctuation (for the love of god, add periods, please!), and use words that are actually widely-accepted?
									</p>

									<p>
										I have taken note of the evolution of online slangs in the past several years, from "noob" and "bruh", to "simp", to "cap", "mid" and "ohio",
										to the more recent "skibidi" and "aura". It is interesting to see how some of these words last mere months before being dominated by new slangs.
										For the record, I am still someone who says "that's cool" or "that's awesome", rather than following the latest trends.
									</p>

									<p>
										Disclaimer: I am taking extra care to not sound like language in the past is superior to the present. I only think that words should "make sense".
										Too many instances when past generations mock new generations without actually listening to what young people are saying. Boomers mock millennials,
										millennials mock Gen Zs, and Gen Zs mock Gen Alphas. Sometimes, newer generations will turn back at older generations and mock in return. This is
										an unacceptable vicious cycle.
									</p>

									<h3>Lock in</h3>

									<p>
										I have to start with this, since it sounds so much like my name. To <i>lock in</i> is to be focused on something, whether it be video
										games, playing a sport (especially in a match), or studying. I think it may derive from homing missiles locking in on a target. When
										we say a missile is locked in/on, it is focused on a target. The usage of this slang is about the same. My opinion on <i>lock in</i>? Although
										I may be biased towards favouring it, but I think an objective perspective would also see <i>lock in</i> as a more reasonable slang relative
										to what I am about to cover, especially since one can logically explain the origin of <i>lock in</i>.
									</p>

									<h3>Skibidi</h3>

									<p>
										Something to do with a floating head in a toilet. I do not acknowledge this as a legitimate word. It is a producable sound, but not a
										word, and has no useful meaning. Perhaps I have no right to judge what constitutes as a word or not, but to express my opinion, not once
										in my life will I ever utter this "slang".
									</p>

									<p>
										I've done some research. Apparently <i>skibidi</i> has been added to the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/skibidi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cambridge Dictionary</a>.
										Does this mean that the general public acknowledges this as a legitmate word?
									</p>

									<h3>Aura</h3>

									<p>
										I think the usage of <i>aura</i> as a slang is a misinterpretation of the word. Aura is a feeling or atmosphere that someone or something
										gives off, for example, "a menacing aura", or "a friendly aura". <i>Aura</i> alone is neutral, and should be preceded by an adjective to
										describe the nature of the aura. As an online slang, it is used as a currency, similar to <i>social credits</i>. I think it makes no sense,
										since "100 aura" does not imply whether the said aura is good or bad.
									</p>

									<h3>Cook</h3>

									<p>
										It took me a long time to understand what <i>cook</i> means. To <i>cook</i> is to do well on something, for example, "I'm cooking in
										Chemistry" means "I'm doing well in Chemistry". To be <i>cooked</i> is the opposite. "I'm getting cooked in Chemistry" means "I'm
										doing horribly in Chemistry", or "Chemistry is destroying me". If Person A <i>cooks</i> Person B, it may mean that Person A has defeated
										or humiliated Person B, similar to <i>roast</i> in slang. "Tom cooked you" and "you got roasted by Tom" mean about the same. <i>Cook</i>,
										<i>roast</i>, or even <i>grill</i> are quite similar slangs and all originate from the idea of cooking food. This I find very interesting.
									</p>

									<h3>Bro</h3>

									<p>
										Instead of referring to the subject by their name, internet users have been using <i>bro</i> to call almost everyone. For example, "bro
										thinks he's smart" or "bro gained generational aura". I think we are degrading to using a singular word to describe everything. <i>Bro</i>
										is short for <i>brother</i>. If only used in the context of chatting with one's friends, or one's literal brother, it would make more
										sense to me.
									</p>

									<h3>Ohio</h3>

									<p>
										What is so special about Ohio? By my understanding, the <i>Ohio</i> slang is used to describe something crazy or unusual, though I
										cannot be sure.
									</p>

									<h3>Alpha/Sigma (male, but not necessarily)</h3>

									<p>
										To say that certain behaviours make one the "alpha/sigma male", or in the other words, the superior male, is absurd. Note that this is not
										only applied to men, but usually used to describe men. Apparently men can be categorized into brackets of <i>sigma</i>, <i>alpha</i>,
										and <i>beta</i>. Ridiculous.
									</p>

									<h3>Buddy</h3>

									<p>
										Although this is not the definition of the actual word, <i>buddy</i> as a slang is almost always used in a derogatory context. When
										Person A calls Person B "buddy", it gives off the same feeling as an adult calling a child "buddy". Perhaps it sounds derogatory
										because Person B is implied to be a child. Because of this negative connotation, I never use <i>buddy</i>.
									</p>

									<h3>Simp</h3>

									<p>
										I think this is a rather misused slang. I interpret <i>simp</i> as someone (usually a male) who obsesses over/spoils a female to the extent
										that it takes a toll on the former's dignity. However, standing up for a female is sometimes enough to get called as a <i>simp</i>. Now I
										am sure we are evolving in the right direction.
									</p>

									<h3>Chat</h3>

									<p>
										An imitation of streamers who call their live chat, well, <i>chat</i>. Here is an example. When asking the general (online) populace, instead
										of "what do you all think?", one might say, "chat, what do we think?", as though one is interacting with an imaginary live chat. I suppose
										there is nothing <i>wrong</i> with this slang, but I would not use it, since streamers are not the people I want to learn from. To each their own. 
									</p>

									<p>
										End note: I have seen videos of Gen Alphas being embarrassed when someone who is not a Gen Alpha says their slangs. It is almost as if Gen Alphas
										acknowledge that their own slangs are...embarrassing. Of course, this might not represent the majority of Gen Alphas. Just an observation. In
										contrary, I would never be embarrassed if someone says "that's cool", just as I say it all the time.
