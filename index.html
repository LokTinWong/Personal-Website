											<h1>Lok Tin Wong</h1>
											<p>About Me</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											I am born in Hong Kong and lived there for 15 years, until my family moved to Vancouver in 2022. In Chinese, my name <i>Lok Tin</i> (樂天)
											means <i>optimistic</i>. It just so happens that I am not usually disappointed or saddened by a situation for too long. Though it does
											depend on the said situation, I am generally quick to move on and attempt to see things in a different light, perhaps a better, more optimistic
											light. My parents never gave me an English name. <i>Lok Tin</i> has much more meaning than a generic English name, and reminds me of my roots.
											Even if I could change my name now, I would still prefer <i>Lok Tin</i>.
										</p>

										<p>
											Note: Please do not simplify my name to <i>Lok</i>. My sister is called <i>Lok Yee</i>, and merely Lok would not differentiate me from her.
											The number of times I have been called <i>Lok</i> by teachers or emails is rather irritating. <i>Lok</i> alone means <i>joy</i>, but that is
											not me. I am Lok Tin.
										</p>

										<p>
											I may not be immune to procrastination, but when I am <i>locked in</i>, or in other words, <i>focused</i> or <i>in the zone</i>, I can make great progress in a
											short period of time. I do not normally use internet slang, but <i>locked in</i> is my high school namesake, for it sounds just like <i>Lok Tin</i>. I treat
											it as a compliment, or a reminder to stay on top of things. I take pride in completing tasks ahead of time; fighting deadlines is not preferable for me.
										</p>

										<p>
											I would call myself a good listener, staying silent as needed and not speaking out of place. I do not normally dominate conversations and make myself the centre
											of attention. Instead, I try to	give everyone a chance to speak while making my own contributions. In the case of group work, I am careful to credit each member;
											I would much rather share the spoils than to take it all for my own. 
										</p>

										<p>
											Long before we had the idea to leave Hong Kong, my parents have always provided me with many opportunities to learn English,
											from books, kindergartens with foreign instructors, to <i>Skype</i> lessons taught by a South African teacher. I would specifically
											credit this <i>Skype</i> teacher, along with my parents for my current proficiency in English. I can speak fluent Cantonese and English,
											as well as intermediate Mandarin. I can write in Traditional Chinese and English. I cannot write in Simplified Chinese, but I can
											interpret some of their characters.

												<h3>Reading</h3>
												<p>
													I have been reading since I was still drinking milk from a baby bottle, thanks to my parents
													seeing great value in books. <i>Horrid Henry</i> and <i>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</i> were some of my favourites.
													Now, I enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction. Fiction includes <i>Percy Jackson</i>, <i>Tom Clancy</i>,
													and <i>The Horus Heresy</i>. Non-fiction is mostly centred around history, a passion of mine, but also
													books about daily-life physics and firearms (educational purposes only).

												<h3>History</h3>
												<p>
													History is my passion. I am into the idea that we can learn from our mistakes in history, even if
													history is rather cyclical. Although I major in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, I have still taken
													history courses in my first two years of university, to further my knowledge. I have not quite decided
													which aspect or time period of history I am most interested in, but I am leaning towards military history.
													I listen to a Swedish metal band, <i>Sabaton</i>, that sings about war stories and correlates with my
													passion.

												<h3>Programming</h3>
												<p>
													My first exposure to programming was playing around with <i>Scratch</i> in primary school, making simple
													platformer games and a dance sequence with several photoshopped frames. Later in secondary/high school and
													my first year of university, I worked on bigger projects with HTML and CSS, JavaScript, and Java.

												<h3>Video Games</h3>
												<p>
													I enjoy playing single-player games, especially ones with a story. Examples include <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i>,
													<i>Watch Dogs 2</i>, and <i>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</i>. Playing through a well-crafted story gives me the same,
													if not more satisfaction than reading a fictional novel. In a text-based role-playing game called <i>Torn</i>,
													I have met a group of great friends. Together, we have built a community of over 200 players in the span of two years.
													I get to use my	programming abilities and <i>Discord</i> expertise to assist the operation of the said community.

												<p>
													I have a YouTube channel of six years with over 200 videos (including the vast majority that I have set to private).
													I used to enjoy recording my gameplay, editing them into videos and uploading them to my channel. With my abilities,
													I have once helped my mother to edit a video of her giving a lecture about Speech Therapy.

													the books I read, the games I play, and military history in general.

													My first official volunteering experience was during high school. The requirement to graduate was 30 hours, but I ended up
													logging 51 hours of picking up garbage, gardening at the Town Centre Park, and removing invasive plants in a nearby creek.
												</p>
												<p>
													Computer Programming 11 and 12 taught me the basics of Java, which was really helpful for first year in university. I made

												<p>
													I finished my first year in UBC with a 87.8 average, taking three <strong>Computer Science</strong> (CPSC) courses over two
													terms. CPSC 110 was particularly difficult as it was my first exposure to recursion. I started the course grumbling about
													the lectures but later understood the concepts through hard work. As a wise man once said, "Just trust the natural recursion!"
													I saw more use with Java in CPSC 210, learning how to make programs composed of multiple files and with a fully-functional GUI.

										<h2>Opinion on Generalizations</h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										Let's just get this out of the way. Don't generalize. There may be cases when generalizations are useful, like marketing tailored to a certain audience
										assumes that this group of people would generally find a specific product appealing. However, generalizing is more often harmful than beneficial. 
									</p>

									<p>
										For example, if there is a video of a man shamelessly cheating on his partner, does this imply that all men are disloyal? If a car accident involves an
										Asian, does this mean that Asians can't drive properly? I find that wild generalizations are often made to justify one's existing prejudice against
										others. Don't do that. If we want to unite and reconcile, don't generalize. Judge each individual by their behaviour and not by the behaviour of others
										in their group.
									</p>

									<p>
										As one spends sufficient time on social media, one begins to understand that certain choices of wording can provoke certain reactions, even if the intention
										is not necessarily to rile people up. Let us use the aforementioned car accident example. Compare these two possible titles for a video that shows the accident:
									</p>

									<p>
										<i>Person Gets Into Car Crash</i><br>
										<i>Asian Gets Into Car Crash</i>
									</p>

									<p>
										Which of the above is potentially provocative? By provocative, I don't mean that Asians would be enraged by the title. What I mean is that the title evokes
										prejudice against Asians, giving keyboard warriors an opportunity to generalize. "Asians can't f**king drive." I can already see it.

										<h2>Opinion on Logical Fallacies</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Ever since taking CPSC 121 and SCIE 113 in UBC, I have been quite hooked on logical fallacies and how often I see them every day, particularly on social media.
										According to the 16Personalities test, I am a <strong>Logistician (ISTJ-T)</strong>, which probably explains why.
										Before we begin, I should acknowledge that we all make logical fallacies from time to time. I do too, although I try my very best not to. I am not perfect,
										but I still think that I can bring a positive change to the world with my words, by, for example, raising awareness of logical fallacies.
									</p>

									<p>
										If you want to make a good argument, be logical. Yes, I know, pathos is a powerful persuasion technique since we all have emotions, but I believe
										that logos eventually prevails. I don't have a problem with pathos, given that it supplements logos. You may notice me using pathos later on.
									</p>

									<p>
										I am going to list several logical fallacies and explain why each of them is problematic.
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>Fallacy:</strong> Criticizing or outright insulting the opponent to make one's argument seem superior. In other words, the ad hominem fallacy.<br>
										<strong>Problem:</strong> I can understand why you might be tempted to do so. If you can paint the opposition as an unreliable source, say, a terrible person, people may reject
										their ideas and prefer yours instead. Think about this though. When we elect a leader to speak and act on our behalf, we want an individual that actually
										does things for the people, and not simply because their opponent is supposedly unfit. Just because candidate A makes candidate B sound like a fool does
										not mean that candidate A is the right person to pick. I am sick and tired of Liberals and Conservatives or Democrats and Republicans repeatedly discrediting
										each other, without justifying why they are the better party to support. Immature kids bickering to no end. What are we paying them for?  
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>Fallacy:</strong> You see ten consecutive videos that all show women cheating on their partners. Hence, you conclude that most/all women are cheaters.<br>
										<strong>Problem:</strong> Good old generalization, but there are actually multiple problems here. First of all, one cannot even deduce the legitimacy of said videos.
										Content on social media are often faked to provoke viewers. That's pathos. Secondly, even if all the videos are real, how does the behaviour of ten, a hundred, or
										even a thousand women reflect the behaviour of most or all women? You cannot extrapolate from such a small set of data. To conclude a trend that exists in the majority,
										one would have to analyze the majority, which is near impossible. Therefore, logically speaking, you can only draw conclusions of the data
										(say, individuals) that you	have studied. The last problem is the social media algorithm. Some may think that if they are frequently shown videos of some behaviour 
										of some people, it is likely that said behaviour of said people is true. "Women cheat. I see it all the time on Instagram Reels." This is doubly wrong. Not
										only is the frequency of which you are shown something unrelated to the legitimacy of that "something"<a href="#footnote-index-1">*</a>, social media algorithms often suggest topics that you've
										seen in the past. It does not mean that videos of women cheating are "common". The algorithm just feeds you what you want to see, creating what is called a confirmation bias.
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>Fallacy:</strong> Either he is this, or he is that.<br>
										<strong>Problem:</strong> "Only a sith deals in absolutes." Excellent quote. What I'm trying to say is, there is more to a person than just two possible extremes. Just because I am not
										a Conservative does not mean I am a Liberal. I can be neither.
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>Fallacy:</strong> Is a kilogram of steel heavier, or is a kilogram of feathers heavier? The answer is steel, because steel is heavier than feathers.<br>
										<strong>Problem:</strong> Do not change the question. We are asking, is <strong>a kilogram</strong> of steel heavier, or <strong>a kilogram</strong> of feathers? We are not
										asking if steel is heavier than feathers<a href="#footnote-index-2">**</a>. It is incorrect to change the opposition's argument in order to better counter it.
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>Fallacy:</strong> If it rains, I will bring an umbrella. Ah, okay, so if it doesn't rain, I won't bring an umbrella.<br>
										<strong>Problem:</strong> <em>If P then Q</em> is not the same as <em>if not P then not Q</em> (its inverse). <em>If P then Q</em> only
										tells you that Q is true if P is true, but not what happens if P is false. You cannot make any conclusions if P is false. In this case,
										we don't know whether or not I will bring an umbrella if it doesn't rain.
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>Fallacy:</strong> If it rains, I will bring an umbrella. Ah, okay, so if I bring an umbrella, it must be raining.<br>
										<strong>Problem:</strong> <em>If P then Q</em> is not the same as <em>if Q then P</em> (its converse). I can bring an umbrella even if it
										is not raining. The only way to contradict my original logic proposition is if it rains and I don't bring an umbrella.
									</p>

									<p>
										I think you get the idea. It is difficult to be completely immune to fallacies. I am certain that I will make many mistakes in future arguments, but hey, at least
										I self-reflect and know what to look out for.
									</p>

									<p id="footnote-index-1">
										<strong>*</strong>Yes, I know. If the majority tells you that eggs are bad, it is quite tempting to believe so, but you should really investigate for yourself. Perhaps I should be
										more specific. The frequency of which you are shown something <strong>on social media</strong> is unrelated to the legitimacy of that "something", because
										social media algorithms will recommend the same kind of videos that you have spent time watching before.
									</p>

									<p id="footnote-index-2">
										<strong>**</strong>By the way, "is steel heavier than feathers" is a poor question. Are you asking for the density of steel and feathers? If so, the
										question should be "is one cubic metre of solid steel heavier, or is one cubic metres of feathers heavier". Even then, you can argue that
										a cubic metre of feathers is vague, because it depends on how compressed the feathers are. Anyway, it is obvious that a certain quantity of steel may
										not weigh the same as another quantity of feathers. To say that "steel is heavier than feathers" does not mean much.

										<h2>Opinion on Online Slang</h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										This section will cover my opinion on online slang, specifically the ones that are most prevalent in 2025. I think it is natural for
										a language to evolve and have new slangs as time passes, but I am unsure if we are evolving for the better if new slangs do not make
										much sense.
									</p>

									<p>
										As someone who spends a fair bit of time writing, it is upsetting to see nonsensical slangs being used rather than the countless beautiful
										words in the language. Of course, no one is expected to write formally when commenting online, but should one not uphold basic grammar,
										proper punctuation (add periods, please!), and use words that are actually widely-accepted?
									</p>

									<p>
										I have taken note of the evolution of online slangs in the past several years, from "noob" and "bruh", to "simp", to "cap", "mid" and "ohio",
										to the more recent "skibidi" and "aura". It is interesting to see how some of these words last mere months before being dominated by new slangs.
										For the record, I am still someone who says "that's cool" or "that's awesome", rather than following the latest trends.
									</p>

									<p>
										Disclaimer: I am taking extra care to not sound like language in the past is superior to the present. I only think that words should "make sense".
										Too many instances when past generations mock new generations without actually listening to what young people are saying. Boomers mock millennials,
										millennials mock Gen Zs, and Gen Zs mock Gen Alphas. Sometimes, newer generations will turn back at older generations and mock in return. This is
										an unacceptable vicious cycle.
									</p>

									<h3>Lock in</h3>

									<p>
										I have to start with this, since it sounds so much like my name. To <i>lock in</i> is to be focused on something, whether it be video
										games, playing a sport (especially in a match), or studying. I think it may derive from homing missiles locking in on a target. When
										we say a missile is locked in/on, it is focused on a target. The usage of this slang is about the same. My opinion on <i>lock in</i>? Although
										I may be biased towards favouring it, but I think an objective perspective would also see <i>lock in</i> as a more reasonable slang relative
										to what I am about to cover, especially since one can logically explain the origin of <i>lock in</i>.
									</p>

									<h3>Skibidi</h3>

									<p>
										Something to do with a floating head in a toilet. I do not acknowledge this as a legitimate word. It is a producable sound, but not a
										word, and has no useful meaning. Perhaps I have no right to judge what constitutes as a word or not, but to express my opinion, not once
										in my life will I ever utter this "slang".
									</p>

									<p>
										I've done some research. Apparently <i>skibidi</i> has been added to the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/skibidi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cambridge Dictionary</a>.
										Does this mean that the general public acknowledges this as a legitmate word?
									</p>

									<h3>Aura</h3>

									<p>
										I think the usage of <i>aura</i> as a slang is a misinterpretation of the word. Aura is a feeling or atmosphere that someone or something
										gives off, for example, "a menacing aura", or "a friendly aura". <i>Aura</i> alone is neutral, and should be preceded by an adjective to
										describe the nature of the aura. As an online slang, it is used as a currency, similar to <i>social credits</i>. I think it makes no sense,
										since "100 aura" does not imply whether the said aura is good or bad.
									</p>

									<h3>Cook</h3>

									<p>
										It took me a long time to understand what <i>cook</i> means. To <i>cook</i> is to do well on something, for example, "I'm cooking in
										Chemistry" means "I'm doing well in Chemistry". To be <i>cooked</i> is the opposite. "I'm getting cooked in Chemistry" means "I'm
										doing horribly in Chemistry", or "Chemistry is destroying me". If Person A <i>cooks</i> Person B, it may mean that Person A has defeated
										or humiliated Person B, similar to <i>roast</i> in slang. "Tom cooked you" and "you got roasted by Tom" mean about the same. <i>Cook</i>,
										<i>roast</i>, or even <i>grill</i> are quite similar slangs and all originate from the idea of cooking food. This I find very interesting.
									</p>

									<h3>Bro</h3>

									<p>
										Instead of referring to the subject by their name, internet users have been using <i>bro</i> to call almost everyone. For example, "bro
										thinks he's smart" or "bro gained generational aura". I think we are degrading to using a singular word to describe everything. <i>Bro</i>
										is short for <i>brother</i>. If only used in the context of chatting with one's friends, or one's literal brother, it would make more
										sense to me.
									</p>

									<h3>Ohio</h3>

									<p>
										What is so special about Ohio? By my understanding, the <i>Ohio</i> slang is used to describe something crazy or unusual, though I
										cannot be sure.
									</p>

									<h3>Alpha/Sigma (male, but not necessarily)</h3>

									<p>
										To say that certain behaviours make one the "alpha/sigma male", or in the other words, the superior male, is absurd. Note that this is not
										only applied to men, but usually used to describe men. Apparently men can be categorized into brackets of <i>sigma</i>, <i>alpha</i>,
										and <i>beta</i>. Ridiculous.
									</p>

									<h3>Buddy</h3>

									<p>
										Although this is not the definition of the actual word, <i>buddy</i> as a slang is almost always used in a derogatory context. When
										Person A calls Person B "buddy", it gives off the same feeling as an adult calling a child "buddy". Perhaps it sounds derogatory
										because Person B is implied to be a child. Because of this negative connotation, I never use <i>buddy</i>.
									</p>

									<h3>Simp</h3>

									<p>
										I think this is a rather misused slang. I interpret <i>simp</i> as someone (usually a male) who obsesses over/spoils a female to the extent
										that it takes a toll on the former's dignity. However, standing up for a female is sometimes enough to get called as a <i>simp</i>. Now I
										am sure we are evolving in the right direction.
									</p>

									<h3>Chat</h3>

									<p>
										An imitation of streamers who call their live chat, well, <i>chat</i>. Here is an example. When asking the general (online) populace, instead
										of "what do you all think?", one might say, "chat, what do we think?", as though one is interacting with an imaginary live chat. I suppose
										there is nothing <i>wrong</i> with this slang, but I do not use it since I am not a streamer talking to a live chat.
									</p>

									<p>
										End note: I have seen videos of Gen Alphas being embarrassed when a non-Gen Alpha uses their slangs. It is almost as if Gen Alphas
										acknowledge that their own slangs are embarrassing. In contrary, I would never be embarrassed if someone uses the slangs that I often use.<br>
										To not fall into the trap of generalizing, I know that this might not reflect the majority of Gen Alphas.
