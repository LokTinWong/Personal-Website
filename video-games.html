										<h1>Video Games</h1>
									</header>

									<!-- Content -->
										<p>
											I have played my fair share of video games over the past ten years. My parents used to impose very strict gaming quotas, limiting me
											to only 25 minutes a week. Along with this came the restriction of YouTube; I could only watch 10 minutes a week of YouTube at the time.
											Hence, I have no recollection of the memes that were prevalent then, and my friends now are shocked that I do not know them. Back to the
											topic of video games, my gaming limitation has grown more lenient over time, until I am finally trusted to control my own gaming time.
										</p>

										<p>
											What are video games to me? An escape? A life I cannot live in reality? Just simple entertainment? It depends on the genre.
										</p>

										<p>
											Story-driven single-player games are basically books that I read or movies that I watch. It is role-playing a character in a well-crafted story.
											In my opinion, they are not for high intensity excitement but to provide an experience akin to reading an excellent novel, or to those who cannot
											visualize images from words, watching a movie.
										</p>

										<p>
											Simulator/strategy games give me a different perspective on the world we live in. How does city planning work? What resources does a medieval colony need to survive?
											How do kings manage their vassals, deal with potential rivals, and maintain a family's heritance? All can be explored in simulator games, and it is through
											answering these questions that gives me satisfaction.
										</p>

										<p>
											Here is a comprehensive list of the video games that I have played. I especially recommend the ones preceded by 👍, if you find your taste similar to mine.
										</p>

											<li>Ready Or Not</li>
											<li>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</li>

										</ul>

										<p>
											I would not describe myself as a hardcore gamer. I have no interest in spending countless hours to make it to the top of a leaderboard,
											or to prove that I am better than anyone in a game. Instead, I value the unforgettable moments of playing with my friends, especially those that
											I have known for years and are now separated across continents.

									<h2 id="blog-pvp">Opinion on PVP Games</h2>

									<p>
										PVP stands for <i>player-versus-player</i>. I define a PVP game as any game that involves competition between players. This is certainly not limited
										to first-person shooters like <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i> or <i>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</i>; racing games also count, if
										players can race against each other.
									</p>

									<p>
										Let me get this out of the way. When I play a video game, I expect enjoyment in every spent moment. I do not want to "grind" for hours
										before a game actually becomes fun.
									</p>

									<p>
										Now, let us discuss the nature of PVP games. Most PVP games take quite some practice before one is proficient at it. Before achieving proficiency, one
										is expected to lose frequently, and inevitably, receive less enjoyment than someone who is more skilled. Say, if a game requires 100 hours of
										playtime before one can be considered "proficient", then the initial 100 hours would be suffering. Some games claim to have skill-based matchmaking, but
										I really doubt the effectiveness of their matchmaking algorithm. Which statistic(s) best represents a player's skill? Is skill even quantifiable?
										Anyway, my point is, if I have to practice playing a game a fair bit before I can truly enjoy it, then I am not playing it. Video games are not
										the same as sports. One may gain health benefits playing a sport, even if they are a novice. I cannot say the same about video games. I do not think
										there any inherent benefits in gaming, aside from having fun. If I am not having fun, I am not playing.
									</p>

									<p>
										Another problem with PVP games is the pressure to maintain one's skill. Consistency is important. If one takes a break from playing a competitive
										game, they may find their skills "rusty" upon returning, along with significantly decreased enjoyment. The way I see it, there are only two options <a href="#footnote">*</a>,
										since casually playing a competitive game will only lead to many losses, heavy blows to self-esteem, and deteriorating sanity.
										<strong>Option 1,</strong> either one completely stays away from PVP games, or <strong>Option 2</strong>, one spends considerable time playing a PVP game consistently.
										Despite	my love for video games, I am unwilling to let them take up the majority of my day, so I choose the <strong>Option 1</strong>. Single-player games are all I need,
										for I can quit anytime I want, and return anytime I want.
									</p>

									<p>
										I have once played 30 hours of <i>Apex Legends</i>. I did not enjoy any moment of those 30 hours. It was the false hope of "it's going to get better" that
										kept me from quitting any earlier, but I have learned my lesson now.
									</p>

									<p>
										In very simple terms, a PVP game is a competition of which player is willing to spent the most time of their life playing said game. When I think of the matter this way,
										the mere thought of getting into a PVP game makes me reel in disgust. You can argue that single-player games are also a waste of time, but I can withdraw from them whenever
										I wish. Can you take a six-month break from <i>Apex Legends</i>, return to it and still be as skilled as you were before? I think not. Can I take a six-month break from
										<i>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</i>, return to my playthrough and still have fun? Hell yeah.
									</p>

									<h2 id="blog-p2w-micro">Opinion on Pay-To-Win and Microtransactions</h2>

									<h3>Pay-To-Win</h3>

									<p>
										<strong>Pay-To-Win</strong>, which we will call <strong>P2W</strong> for short, is when players can spend real money to gain advantages over others.
										Said advantages include superior equipment, more or better rewards<a href="#footnote-1">*</a> after completing tasks<a href="#footnote-2">**</a>,
										or being able to perform actions that others cannot (<i>Call of War</i> is an example). Even if these advantages are small, I would still regard
										it as P2W. Any kind of performance boost attained through spending real money is P2W. This is not to say that P2W games do not require skill,
										but if spending real money gives a player advantages over opponents who do not spend, that undermines the importance of skill.
									</p>

									<p>
										I should acknowledge that I speak from a player's perspective, and not from a business-making perspective. Regardless of who I am, however, I would still
										argue that a <i>good/ethical</i> game should strive towards finding a win-win situation for both players and business owners. I would then argue that P2W games
										favour the business owner more than the enjoyment of players.
									</p>

									<p>
										For example, <i>War Thunder</i> is a P2W game. One can purchase
										<a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/war-thunder-guide-sales-premiums-and-premium-account/99961" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vehicles that range between 30 USD to 70 USD</a>
										that clearly outperform standard vehicles. Some premium vehicles can be directly bought using an in-game currency, <i>Golden Eagles (GE)</i>. However, GE is what one would call a <i>premium</i>
										currency, meaning that its main source comes from being bought with real money, and not through completing in-game tasks<a href="#footnote-2">**</a>. Though it may be possible to
										earn enough GE to buy a premium vehicle without spending real money, the time required is gargantuan, to a point that it feels more like a grind than
										actually satisfying gaming sessions. Unfortunately, I have to admit that it is incredibly subjective on exactly how much time is considered gargantuan.
										My rebuttal to this counterargument is that a game cannot be considered fair if spending money decreases the time it takes to finish an in-game task, regardless of
										how large that time difference is.
										
									</p>
										It is also worth noting that <i>War Thunder</i> is free to download. Perhaps being P2W is very profitable for the developers, but let us
										first look at a different game.
									<p>

									</p>

									<p>
										<i>Apex Legends</i> is also free to download, yet not P2W. Any <strong>microtransactions</strong> (we will get into this topic later) in the game are
										purely cosmetics and have no effect on one's performance. I have heard that one can spend some kind of premium currency to purchase new characters, but
										I am not sure if this constitutes a "performance boost". A new character may have new abilities, but that does not necessarily mean that they are better
										than the characters that one starts with, for free. Contrary to <i>War Thunder</i>, <i>Apex Legends</i> can make money just from selling cosmetics
										that do not impact performance, unlike the premium vehicles in <i>War Thunder</i>.
									</p>

									<p>
										Here is my take on P2W games. Personally, I would never play them. A battle of "whose wallet is thicker" is pointless and not something I would take part
										in. Even if it is possible to compete without spending, the additional effort one needs to put in is not worth my time. I do not enjoy Player Versus
										Player (PVP) games to begin with, but if I have to play one, I would still most definitely prefer skill-based rather than P2W. If a game has never been advertised for
										providing skill-based PVP, then there is nothing wrong if it turns out to be P2W. On the other hand, if a game claims to be skill-based but is in fact P2W,
										then the developer of said game is blatantly lying.
									</p>

									<p id="footnote-1">
										*Rewards that allow a player to perform better than others, for example, better equipment, in-game currency that can be used to purchase better equipment,
										greater experience gains to hasten leveling up, etc.
									</p>

									<p id="footnote-2">
										**Tasks, missions, quests, objective, operation, contract, job. Whatever the game calls it, but you get the idea.
									</p>

									<h3>Microtransactions</h3>

									<p>
										<strong>Microtransactions</strong> are purchases that players can make after purchasing the base game. I think they are called <i>micro</i> to give the impression
										that they are very affordable. Microtransactions can give performance boosts (P2W), unlock certain content (not P2W), or purchased for cosmetic purposes (also not P2W).
										Hence, all P2W games have microtransactions, but not all microtransactions exist only in P2W games.
									</p>

									<p>
										Here is my take on (non-P2W) microtransactions. In the end, you decide whether or not to purchase them. I do not see a point in complaining that
										cosmetics are too expensive, since cosmetics are not necessary to win. If not being able to afford cosmetics is a deal-breaker for you,
										then stop playing the game. It sends more of a message to the developers than whining on the internet. That is, if the developers do not already
										make enough money from those that are willing to spend. On a side note, if you care this much about cosmetics, go play a dress-up game.
									</p>

									<p>
										I fail to understand why people moan and groan so much about the pricing. If the microtransaction is more than you are willing to spend, do not make the
										purchase. If the microtransaction is affordable and you want to look flashy, or you want to support a free-to-play game, go for it. It does seem ridiculous
										if a single microtransaction costs 50% or more of the base game<a href="#footnote-3">***</a>, but in the end, no one is forcing you to make that purchase. Remember that this is
										highly subjective. Just because you find microtransactions too expensive does not imply that everyone feels the same. I find that some internet users
										conclude that a game is <i>bad</i> because something dissatisifies them, without looking for any kind of general consensus among the community. Or, their idea of
										a general consensus is merely an agreement between them and their friends.
									</p>

									<p>
										<i>Total War: Warhammer III</i> does an excellent job with their microtransactions. Now, subjectively speaking (as the majority of this "blog" is also
										subjective), to purchase all the downloadable content (DLC) of this game is quite expensive. For context, DLCs in this game unlock new factions that one
										can play as, whether that be Elves, Dwarves, or Greenskins. Even though these factions are locked behind DLCs, players can still fight against them (in the form of computer opponents)
										and get a feel of how they perform before buying their associated DLCs. I might not have the DLC for Dwarves, but I can play as
										Grand Cathay and attack them, observing their units and see if I want to play as them. This allows one to better gauge if the DLCs are worth buying.
										Giving players an opportunity to experience the product beforehand makes <i>Total War: Warhammer III</i> really special.
									</p>

									<p>
										There has been some recent controversy about <i>Total War: Warhammer III</i> for not fixing the computer behaviour of certain factions, but that is a story
										for another day.
									</p>

									<p>
										<i>The Sims 4</i> is an interesting case. The base game is free, but
										<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/1222670/The_Sims_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DLCs range between 7 CAD to 55 CAD each</a>.
										More specifically:
									</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Expansion Packs each cost 54.99 CAD</li>
										<li>Game Packs each cost 29.99 CAD</li>
										<li>Stuff Packs each cost 14.99 CAD</li>
										<li>Kits each cost 6.99 CAD</li>
									</ul>

									<p>
										These are not microtransactions, but more like "megatransactions". If the packs are expensive because the base game is free, I can somewhat
										understand. Comparing <i>The Sims 4</i> with the pricing of other games that I have played, I would say that the base game plus one Expansion or Game Pack
										is worth somewhere between 20 CAD to 30 CAD. However, for an Expansion Pack alone to cost 54.99 CAD is unacceptable for me, even after considering that the
										base game is free. One pack do not contain nearly enough content to be worth more than <i>Helldivers 2</i>. I think purchasing one pack along with the base
										game is worth it, but the more additional packs one buys, the less worth it is. And since I am not a hypocrite, I am not complaining to get EA to
										lower the prices. I just refuse to buy the packs.
									</p>

									<p id="footnote-3">
										***As the name suggests, microtransactions should be <i>micro</i>, hence a microtransaction that costs 50% or more of the base game sounds out of place. Also think
										about this. Say, a base game costs 50 CAD, and one of its microtransactions costs 30 CAD. If 50 CAD can buy you a game, 30 CAD should buy you more than half
										that game, yet microtransactions often add much less content than half of the base game. Seems not worth the money (not applicable if the base game is free). In the
										case that the microtransaction costs more than the base game, should it not contain more content than the base game? If it offers more than the base game,
										should it be a standalone game? I think there are problems with these "megatransactions".
									</p>

									<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

									<ul>
										<li>I do not like P2W games and would never play them for the rest of my life.</li>
										<li>P2W games should be made clear that they are P2W. P2W is unacceptable in a game that claims to be skill-based.</li>
										<li>Non-P2W microtransactions are optional, hence I do not understand the reason to complain that they are too expensive.</li>
										<li>I would make microtransactions to support a worthy game developer.</li>
