										<h1>Video Games</h1>
									</header>

									<!-- Content -->
										<p>
											I have played my fair share of video games over the past ten years. My parents used to impose very strict gaming quotas, limiting me
											to only 25 minutes a week. Along with this came the restriction of YouTube; I could only watch 10 minutes a week of YouTube at the time.
											Hence, I have no recollection of the memes that were prevalent then, and my friends now are shocked that I do not know them. My gaming
											limiation has grown more lenient over time, until I am trusted to control the amount of time I spend on games.
										</p>

										<p>
											Here is a comprehensive list of most of the video games I have played. The ones preceded by üëç are my recommendations.
										</p>

										<p>
											Here are games that I have never played, but greatly interests me.
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>For Honor</li>
											<li>Titanfall 2</li>
											<li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>
											<li>Ready Or Not</li>
											<li>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</li>
											<li>Chivalry 2</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											I would not describe myself as a hardcore gamer. I have no interest in spending countless hours to make it to the top of a leaderboard,
											or to prove that I am better than anyone in a game. Instead, I value the unforgettable moments of playing with my friends, especially those that
											I have known for years and are now separated across continents.

									<h2 id="games-blog">Opinion on Pay-To-Win and Microtransactions</h2>

									<h3>Pay-To-Win</h3>

									<p>
									<strong>Pay-To-Win</strong>, which we will call <strong>P2W</strong> for short, is when players can spend real money to gain advantages over others.
									Said advantages include superior equipment, more daily login rewards<a href="#footnote-1">*</a>, or better rewards<a href="#footnote-1">*</a> after completing tasks<a href="#footnote-2">**</a>. Even if these advantages are small,
									I would still regard it as P2W. Any kind of performance boost attained through spending real money is P2W. This is not to say that P2W games do not
									require skill, but spending real money can give a player massive advantages over their opponents who do not spend, and may sometimes undermine the
									importance of skill.
									</p>

									<p>
									I should acknowledge that I speak from a player's perspective, and not from a business-making perspective. I would, however, argue that a "good" game
									should strive towards finding a win-win situation for both players and business owners. I would then argue that P2W games favour the business owner more
									than the enjoyment of players.
									</p>

									<p>
									For example, <i>War Thunder</i> is a P2W game. One can purchase
									<a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/war-thunder-guide-sales-premiums-and-premium-account/99961" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vehicles that range between 30 USD to 70 USD</a>
									that clearly outperform standard
									vehicles. Some premium vehicles can be directly bought using an in-game currency, Golden Eagles (GE). However, GE is what one would call a <i>premium</i>
									currency, meaning that its main source comes from being bought with real money, and not through completing in-game tasks<a href="#footnote-2">**</a>. Though it may be possible to
									earn enough GE to buy a premium vehicle without spending real money, the time required is gargantuan, to a point that it feels more like a grind than
									actually satisfying gaming sessions. Unfortunately, I have to admit that it is incredibly subjective on exactly how much time is considered gargantuan.
									It is also worth noting that <i>War Thunder</i> is free to download. Perhaps being P2W is the major source of income for the game developers, but let us
									first look at a different game.
									</p>

									<p>
									<i>Apex Legends</i> is also free to download, yet not P2W. Any <strong>microtransactions</strong> (we will get into this topic later) in the game are
									purely cosmetics and have no effect on one's performance. I have heard that one can spend some kind of premium currency to purchase new characters, but
									I am not sure if this constitutes a "performance boost". A new character may have new abilities, but that does not necessarily mean that they are better
									than the characters one starts with. Contrary to <i>War Thunder</i>, <i>Apex Legends</i>'s major source of income for the game developers seems to come
									from selling cosmetics that do not impact performance as premium vehicles do.
									</p>

									<p>
									Here is my take on P2W games. Personally, I would never play them. A battle of "whose wallet is thicker" is pointless and not something I would take part
									in. Even if it is possible to compete without spending, the additional effort one needs to put in is not worth my time. I do not enjoy Player Versus
									Player (PVP) games, but if I have to play one, I would most definitely prefer skill-based rather than P2W. If a game has never been advertised for
									providing skill-based PVP, then there is nothing wrong if it turns out to be P2W. On the other hand, if a game claims to be skill-based but is in fact P2W,
									then the developer of said game is blatantly lying.
									</p>

									<p id="footnote-1">
									*Rewards that allow a player to perform better than others, for example, better equipment, in-game currency that can be used to purchase better equipment,
									greater experience gains to hasten leveling up, etc.
									</p>

									<p id="footnote-2">
									**Tasks, missions, quests, objective, operation, contract, job. Whatever the game calls it, but you get the idea.
									</p>

									<h3>Microtransactions</h3>

									<p>
									<strong>Microtransactions</strong> are purchases that a player can make after purchasing a video game. Microtransactions can give performance boosts (P2W)
									or only for cosmetic purposes (not P2W). Hence, all P2W games have microtransactions, but not all microtransactions exist only in P2W games.
									</p>

									<p>
									Here is my take on (not-P2W) microtransactions. In the end, you decide whether or not to purchase cosmetics. I do not see a point in complaining that
									cosmetics are too expensive, for cosmetics are not necessary to, well, win. If the microtransaction is more than you are willing to spend, do not make the
									purchase. If the microtransaction is affordable and you want to look flashy, or you want to support a free-to-play game, go for it. It does seem ridiculous
									if a single microtransaction costs 50% or more of the base game<a href="#footnote-3">***</a> but regardless, no one is forcing you to make that purchase. Remember that this is
									highly subjective. Just because you find microtransactions too expensive does not imply that everyone feels the same. I find that some internet users
									conclude that a game is "bad" because something dissatisifies them, without looking for any kind of general consensus among the community.
									</p>

									<p>
									<i>Total War: Warhammer III</i> does an excellent job with their microtransactions. Now, subjectively speaking (as the majority of this "blog" is also
									subjective), to purchase all the downloadable content (DLC) of this game is quite expensive. For context, DLCs in this game unlock new factions that one
									can play as, whether that be Elves, Dwarves, or Greenskins. Even though these factions are locked behind DLCs, players can still fight against them and get
									a feel of how they play. I might not have the DLC for Dwarves, but I can play as Grand Cathay and attack them, observing their units and see if I want to
									try playing as them. This allows one to better decide if the DLCs are worth buying. Giving players an opportunity to experience the product before going
									ahead with the microtransaction makes <i>Total War: Warhammer III</i> really special.
									</p>

									<p>
									<i>The Sims 4</i> is an interesting case. The base game is free, but
									<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/1222670/The_Sims_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DLCs range between 7 CAD to 55 CAD each</a>.
									More specifically:
									</p>

									<ul>
									<li>Expansion Packs each cost 54.99 CAD</li>
									<li>Game Packs each cost 29.99 CAD </li>
									<li>Stuff Packs each cost 14.99 CAD</li>
									<li>Kits each cost 6.99 CAD</li>
									</ul>

									<p>
									These are not microtransactions, but more like "<strong>mega</strong>transactions". If the packs are expensive because the base game is free, I can somewhat
									understand. Comparing <i>The Sims 4</i> with the pricing of other games that I have played, I would say that the base game plus one Expansion or Game Pack
									is worth somewhere between 20 CAD to 30 CAD. However, for an Expansion Pack alone to cost 54.99 CAD is unacceptable for me, even after considering that the
									base game is free. I think purchasing one pack along with the base game is worth it, but the more additional packs one buys, the less worth it is. Then again,
									as I said earlier, no one is forcing me to make any purchases.
									</p>


									<p id="footnote-3">
									***As the name suggests, microtransactions should be <i>micro</i>, hence a microtransaction that costs 50% or more of the base game sounds out of place. Also think
									about this. Say, a base game costs 50 CAD, and one of its microtransactions costs 30 CAD. If 50 CAD can buy you a game, 30 CAD should buy you more than half
									that game, yet microtransactions often add much less content than the base game. Seems not worth the money (not applicable if the base game is free). In the
									case that the microtransaction costs more than the base game, should it not contain more content than the base game? If it offers more than the base game,
									should it be a standalone game? I think there are problems with these "megatransactions".
									</p>

									<p>
									<strong>Final thoughts</strong>: I do not like P2W games. Anyway, they should be make it clear that they are P2W. P2W is unacceptable in a game that claims to
									be skill-based. Non-P2W microtransactions are optional, hence it is pointless to complain that they are too expensive. I would make microtransactions to
									support a free-to-play game, but not if the microtransactions cost more than 50% of the base game.
