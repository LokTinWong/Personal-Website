                                        <strong><i>Sabaton</i></strong> is my jam. Since discovering them in 2021, I have been listening to them very often. I am
										unsure if <i>Sabaton</i> started my passion for history (especially military history), or if they are history teachers who
										strengthened my preexisting interest.
                                    </p>

									<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
										I am going to quickly thrown in my opinion here. History is "boring" if one is only trying to memorize dates and timelines. Otherwise, history
										is extremely interesting, to see how past actions affect the present and future, and how we may prevent ourselves from making the
										same mistakes our ancestors made. History is beyond just learning about the past, but also to craft a better future through studying our
										predecessors.

                                        <i>Sabaton</i> is a Swedish metal band that sings songs about real war stories. Instead of glorifying war, I think <i>Sabaton</i>
                                        simply tells us the experiences of soldiers from different eras, in hopes that we would remember the sacrifices they made. War
                                        is an ugly business. Diplomatic failure of political leaders cause the loss of countless lives. It is through <i>Sabaton</i>'s
                                        songs that we do not forget such lives.
                                    </p>

                                    <p style="background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">
                                        The day not half over<br>
                                        And ten thousand slain<br>
                                        And now there's nobody remembers our names<br>
                                        And that's how it is for a soldier<br><br>

                                        - <i>1916</i>, by Motörhead. Sabaton also did a cover of this song with minor changes to the lyrics. Battle of the Somme, 1916.

										When they face death they're all alike<br>
										No right or wrong<br>
										Rich or poor<br>
										No matter who they served before<br>
										Good or bad<br>
										They're all the same<br>
										Rest side by side now<br><br>

										- <i>A Lifetime Of War</i>, by Sabaton. Thirty Years War, 17th century.
									</p>

									<p>
										<i>Sabaton</i> does not just tell stories from the victor's perspective. <i>Hearts of Iron</i> tells of the 12th Army of World War Two
										Germany evacuating civilians out of Berlin and into territory controlled by the U.S., even though they were instructed to attack the
										Russians.
									</p>

									<p style="background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">
										Who'll survive and who will die?<br>
										Up to Kriegsglück to decide<br>
										Those who made it cross, without a loss, have reason to reflect<br>
										<strong>It is not about Berlin, it is not about the Reich</strong><br>
										It's about the men, who fought for them, what peace can they expect?<br><br>

										- <i>Hearts of Iron</i>, by Sabaton. The <strong>bolded</strong> part may have been said by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_Wenck#Battle_of_Berlin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walther Wenck</a>,
										the general of the 12th Army during the Battle of Berlin.

										My only interaction with <i>Sabaton</i>'s official Instragram account. I am well aware that the people managing the account might not be the actual musicians of the

									<h2>Profound Sabaton Songs (recommended)</h2>

									<p>
										I want to end this page with one last excerpt from one of <i>Sabaton</i>'s songs. They are excellent storytellers. Straightforward,
										rhyming lyrics touch me more than the majority of pop music nowadays.
									</p>

									<p style="background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">
										Young men are dying<br>
										They pay the price<br>
										Oh how they suffer<br>
										So tell me what's the price of a mile<br><br>

										(Amazing instrumental break)<br><br>

										There's no price for a mile<br><br>

										- <i>The Price of a Mile</i>, by Sabaton.
